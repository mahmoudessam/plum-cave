# üçë Plum Cave: Your Secure Cloud Backup Solution

![Plum Cave Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
*Secure your data with confidence.*

---

## Overview

Plum Cave is a cloud backup solution designed to keep your data safe. It uses advanced encryption methods to ensure your information remains private and secure. Our approach combines the **ChaCha20** stream cipher, **Serpent-256 CBC** block cipher, and **HMAC-SHA3-512** for data encryption. Additionally, we utilize **ML-KEM-1024** for quantum-resistant key exchange, making your backups resilient against future threats.

## Features

- **Client-Side Encryption**: Your data is encrypted on your device before it ever reaches the cloud. This means only you can access your information.
  
- **End-to-End Encryption**: With end-to-end encryption, your data remains protected throughout its journey from your device to the cloud.

- **Quantum Resistance**: By using ML-KEM-1024, Plum Cave prepares for future quantum threats, ensuring your data stays safe.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Plum Cave works seamlessly across various platforms, including web applications built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**.

- **Static Compilation**: The application is statically compiled for improved performance and security.

## Encryption Details

### ChaCha20

ChaCha20 is a fast and secure stream cipher that provides excellent performance on a wide range of devices. It is designed to be secure against various types of attacks.

### Serpent-256 CBC

Serpent is a block cipher known for its security. The CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode adds an extra layer of protection by ensuring that identical plaintext blocks encrypt to different ciphertext blocks.

### HMAC-SHA3-512

HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) ensures the integrity and authenticity of your data. SHA3-512 is one of the latest hashing algorithms, providing strong security.

### ML-KEM-1024

ML-KEM-1024 is a key exchange mechanism that is resistant to quantum attacks. This means that even as technology evolves, your data remains protected.
